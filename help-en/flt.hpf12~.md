# flt.hpf12~


High-pass second order Butterworth filter

---

A high-pass filter is an electronic filter that passes signals with a frequency
            higher than a certain cutoff frequency and attenuates signals with frequencies lower
            than the cutoff frequency.
Butterworth filter is a type of filter designed to have a frequency response as
            flat as possible in the passband.
