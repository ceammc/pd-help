# math.cexp~


exponent of a complex signals

---

Base-e exponential of complex signal, that is e (Euler&#39;s number, 2.7182818) raised
            to the complex signal power
The complex exponential function e^z for z = x+jy equals e^x (cos(y) + j
            sin(y))
The exponential function is an entire function in the complex plane and has no
            branch cuts
