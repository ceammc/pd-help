# math.erf~


error function for signals

---

In statistics, for non-negative values of x, the error function has the following
            interpretation:
for a random variable Y that is normally distributed with mean 0 and variance 1/2,
            erf x is the probability that Y falls in the range [âˆ’x, x]
