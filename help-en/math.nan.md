# math.nan


Not a Number, unrepresentable value

---

In computing, NaN, standing for not a number, is a numeric data type value
            representing an undefined or unrepresentable value, especially in floating-point
            calculations. Systematic use of NaNs was introduced by the IEEE 754 floating-point
            standard in 1985, along with the representation of other non-finite quantities like
            infinities.<br>
