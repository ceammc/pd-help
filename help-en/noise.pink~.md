Pink noise generator

Pink noise or 1/f noise is a signal or process with a frequency spectrum such that
            the power spectral density (energy or power per frequency interval) is inversely
            proportional to the frequency of the signal.
In pink noise, each octave (halving/doubling in frequency) carries an equal amount
            of noise energy.
The name arises from the pink appearance of visible light with this power
            spectrum.
