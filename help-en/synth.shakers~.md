PhISEM (Physically Informed Stochastic Event Modeling) is an algorithmic approach
            for simulating collisions of multiple independent sound producing objects. This class
            is a meta-model that can simulate a Maraca, Sekere, Cabasa, Bamboo Wind Chimes, Water
            Drops, Tambourine, Sleighbells, and a Guiro.
PhOLIES (Physically-Oriented Library of Imitated Environmental Sounds) is a
            similar approach for the synthesis of environmental sounds. This class implements
            simulations of breaking sticks, crunchy snow (or not), a wrench, sandpaper, and
            more.
